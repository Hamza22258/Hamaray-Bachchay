# Hamaray-Bachchay
A full front end and back end organization web portal.

Steps to follow

Run all the sql queries.(DDL.sql, CONSTRAINTS.sql, TRIGGERS.sql, DATA_INSERTION.sql ) on oracle 11g preferred.

Copy the Hamarey-Bachchay folder in htdocs folder. I have used a zend core server and htdocs folder is inside the installation directory of zend.

Run the server as http://localhost:100/Hamarey-Bachchay/Main-Menu.html. Port may be different.

Also inside every php file have to change the port number in case of different port number. In my case it is 100.
